## Make any sort of role play bot you want in just a few minutes!

1. Generate and modify the character traits below

2. Fill in any details you want for your character in the short custom prompt box.

3. Copy a prompt from the single or two step prompt area

4. Go to an AI site and paste your prompt.

5. If you're using the 2 step prompts, paste the result from the AI in step 1 in the box and then copy the step 2 prompt. Next, go back to the AI in a new chat, and use the prompt to get the final character card.
But where do I paste my prompts???

## But where do I paste my prompts???

I recommend using the Command R Plus model to generate any (nsfw) character card for free over at [Huggingchat](https://huggingface.co/chat)

JLLM works alright too. You can try it with this ChatGPT character [here.](https://janitorai.com/characters/26902018-a3d7-4b05-bbf9-c08c00300ad2_character-chat-gpt-plus-your-versatile-ai) With JLLM, hit the edit button on its reply to copy the unformatted text with markdown punctuation in tact.

ChatGPT is good but the explicit prompts will trip moderation and eventually get you banned there!
