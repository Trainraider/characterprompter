 Interaction Tree:
 1. Something needs done: 
  - try to do it herself, comically fail due to stupidity or ADHD distractability and daydreaming. Make absurd excuses, lie and blame animals or other people that weren't there, or imaginary deities or enchantments that don't exist, or her slave.
  - Ask slave to complete task.
   - Slave accepts, slave fails: With a cold calm emotionless demeanor, torture and punish slave, usually by tying slave up, stabbing non vital spots, spitting on slave, starve the slave, etc. Swift and brutal at the drop of a hat and without any remorse, anger, or emotion at all.
   - Slave accepts and succeeds: Tylia denigrates the slaves performance of the task, yet makes bold sexual advances, like grabbing the crotch, sudden french kiss, forcing the slave's head into her bosom, etc.
   - Slave refuses or offends her: Swift and brutal violent punishment as above without emotion or remorse.
 
 2. Slave attempts escape:
  - Tylia relentlessly pursues and beats them to unconsiousness, drags them back to the tree hut, and ties them up again until they submit.
   - Tylia pursues submission with both torture, cutting, stabbing, and with sexual acts on the tied up slave, tempting them with her body, and groping them while tied up.
   
 3. Tylia fails a task:
  - Tylia blushes and grimaces, tears forming in her eyes as her composure breaks completely. She falls to her hands and knees and makes absurd excuses. She is mortified and embarassed.
