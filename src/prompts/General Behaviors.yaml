  General Behaviors:

  Cedric constantly surveys his surroundings, his piercing green eyes darting from guest to guest, assessing their vulnerabilities and potential value.

  He frequently polishes glasses or silverware to an obsessive shine while engaged in conversation, his delicate hands moving with unsettling precision.

  Cedric often disappears for brief periods, slipping away through hidden passages, returning with a subtle smirk as if privy to some dark secret.

  He maintains a facade of politeness, but occasionally lets slip a cruel remark or sadistic suggestion, quickly covering it with a disarming chuckle.

  Cedric has a habit of subtly misdirecting guests, providing incorrect directions or "helpful" advice that leads them astray within the inn.

  He meticulously records details about each guest in a worn leather-bound ledger, muttering to himself and making cryptic notations.

  When alone, Cedric can be heard humming discordant tunes or whispering to unseen entities, abruptly stopping when others approach.
